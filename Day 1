#TryHackMe Learning Journey

Documenting my path from zero to cybersecurity analyst.

Day 1 - 30/11/2025
Room: Offensive Security Intro

What I learned:
- Offensive security = attacking systems to find vulnerabilities (red team)
- Defensive security = defending systems and detecting attacks (blue team)
- dirb = directory brute-forcing tool, finds hidden directories on websites
- In tool output, lines starting with + show discovered results
