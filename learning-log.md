#TryHackMe Learning Journey

Documenting my path from zero to cybersecurity analyst.

## Progress Summary
- **Days active:** 4
- **Rooms completed:** 4 (1 review session)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 1 - November 30th, 2025
**Room:** Offensive Security Intro

What I learned:
- Offensive security = attacking systems to find vulnerabilities (red team)
- Defensive security = defending systems and detecting attacks (blue team)
- dirb = directory brute-forcing tool, finds hidden directories on websites
- In tool output, lines starting with + show discovered results

**Key takeaway:** Security requires understanding both attack and defense perspectives

## Day 2 - December 1st, 2025
**Room:** Careers in Cyber

**What I learned:**
- Security Analyst: monitors systems and analyzes threats
- Security Engineer: builds and maintains security infrastructure
- Incident Responder: handles active security breaches
- Digital Forensics Examiner: investigates security incidents and collects evidence
- Malware Analyst: reverse engineers malicious software
- Penetration Tester: ethically hacks systems to find vulnerabilities
- Red Teamer: simulates real-world attacks to test defenses
- Defensive security areas: monitoring, detection, incident response, threat intelligence, vulnerability management
- SOC (Security Operations Centre): centralized team monitoring security 24/7
- SIEM systems: act as "defensive radar" collecting and analyzing security logs
- Linux commands: ls, cd, cat, la (list files including hidden)
- Windows commands: dir, dir /a (list all files including hidden)
- HTTP logs: records of web traffic useful for detecting attacks

**Created:** Anki cards for security roles and defensive concepts

## Day 3 - December 3rd, 2025
**Rooms:** What is Networking, Intro to LAN

**What I learned:**
- Network fundamentals: devices connected together to communicate
- IP addresses (like home addresses) vs MAC addresses (like serial numbers)
- Private addresses identify devices on local network, public addresses identify devices on internet
- Octet: group of 8 bits in an IP address
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on local networks
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): automatically assigns IP addresses to devices
- DHCP process: Discover → Offer → Request → ACK
- Network topologies: bus, star, ring
- Router: connects different networks together
- Switch: connects devices within the same network
- Subnetting: dividing larger networks into smaller sub-networks
- Subnet mask: defines which part of IP is network vs host
- Default gateway: device that routes traffic to other networks
- ping command: tests connectivity using ICMP protocol

**Created:** 56 Anki flashcards covering networking concepts, protocols, and terminology

## Day 4 - December 5th, 2025
**Room:** Review of "What is Networking" and "Intro to LAN"

**What I learned:**
- Re-learned networking fundamentals for better retention
- Clarified ARP vs DHCP (was confusing them initially)
- ARP specifically maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
- DHCP process: Discover → Offer → Request → ACK
- Solidified understanding of network addressing and subnetting

**Progress:** Reviewed 56 Anki cards from Day 3, concepts clicking better on second pass
